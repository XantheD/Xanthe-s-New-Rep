Git and Git Hub Questions:
--------------------------

1. What is the equivalent git command for when you press the Git Hub app "Sync" button?
git pull --rebase and if there are local changes git push. This merges local changes with the remote repository.

2. What is the command for seeing the repository history via the command line?
git status

3. In the Git Hub app, I can "discard changes" to a file by right clicking on it. What's the equivalent command on the terminal?
git checkout <file name>

4. What does a "pull request" actually do?
"pull request" on github means “merge"

5. What does a .gitignore file do? 
ignore - files that you don’t ever want to add to your repository

6. Why is a .gitignore file useful?
Keeping your history clean. Casting out unwanted or unnecessary files.


7. What is "Open Source" software?
Direct from Wikipedia: “Generally, open source refers to a computer program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design. Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community.”

8. How can "Open Source" software help me with my final project?
It will allow me to draw on preexisting code which already works/has been bug checked.
